// src/supabase/client.ts
// The Supabase client is initialized and exported from src/config.ts
// to make it available globally alongside other configurations.
// If your database logic becomes more complex, you can move the client
// initialization here and export it.

// For now, this file can be left empty or removed.
// We are keeping it to maintain the file structure.
